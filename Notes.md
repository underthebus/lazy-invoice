Generate an invoice for the month of May for every working day, except the
first Monday, at a daily rate of $500.00 itemised as "Consultancy".


I could be invoicing in a foreign currency, and so would like to see the
potential value of the invoice ("Today, this would have a value of Â£5,981
(Advisory only)").
